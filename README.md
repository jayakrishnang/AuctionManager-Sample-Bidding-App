#AuctionManager- A sample bidding application

This is a sample bidding application built for conducting online auctions running on Rails 5.1.

The application was successfully used to host the Ruby Cricket League 2017 Auction and Ruby Carroms League Auction.

Have a look! Good day!

The second upgrade of the application also brings in Scoreboard feature
This allows you to host a cricket match with the teams that have been formed in the auction conducted.
You can quickly enter scores while the match is played and you'll be provided with all the necessary scoreboard views, making your game look like professional.
